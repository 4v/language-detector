## Abut the "languages" folder and files

These files are from the original software from Nakatani Shuyo.

Unfortunately, the data sources from which they were generated are not available.
It looks like it comes from Wikipedia pages.

To generate your own, use a LanguageProfileBuilder and then add text using a TextObject,
then finally store the result with a LanguageProfileWriter.


## Abut the "messages.properties" file

They are used in the CharNormalizer.
